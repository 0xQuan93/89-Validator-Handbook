# NFT Badge System

## Introduction
The NFT badge system serves as a decentralized and verifiable mechanism to recognize agent achievements. Badges are not just rewards but symbols of trust, creativity, and alignment with Project 89’s vision.

## Badge Categories
1. **Mission-Based**: Recognizes high-quality outputs and exceptional mission completion.
2. **Community Engagement**: Rewards consistent participation in rituals and events.
3. **Narrative Contribution**: Celebrates agents who expand the mythos of Project 89.
4. **Scalability Achievements**: Highlights content with potential for adaptation across media platforms.

## Evolution Mechanics
- Badges are dynamic and evolve with continued contributions.
- Example: A “Reality Hacker” badge evolves into “Reality Engineer” after sustained high performance.

## Integration
Badges are minted as NFTs and stored in the `badge_designs/` folder. Validators recommend badge upgrades based on their assessments.
